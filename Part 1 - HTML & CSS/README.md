# HTML & CSS

## Description ðŸ“Œ
In the first part, the website includes only static content which is displayed upon opening each page in the Web Browser, without requiring communication with a Web Server to execute functions or dynamically generate web pages. The implementation is done using HTML5, CSS, and JS, where the latter is only used for complex form validation rules.
> This part is developed in a series of 5 steps/tasks covering different requirements such as structure and content, layout and website style, adaptation to different screens, data input and validation. Each task builds upon the previous tasks.

## Interact with Sofari ðŸ’»ðŸ“±
Open the ```index.html``` page in your Web Browser and through the menu you will find on it, navigate to the tasks (details for the tasks follow below). To see the final result, go to ```Task 5```, which incorporates all previous tasks.

## Implementation Details ðŸ“œ
This part is developed in a series of 5 steps/tasks covering different requirements such as structure and content, layout and website style, adaptation to different screens, data input and validation:

- **Task 1**: For this task, emphasis is given to the semantic elements of HTML and their usage. Classes have been included in some elements, mainly div, with the purpose of assigning meaning, and not for formatting purposes as done in the following tasks.


- **Task 2**: We focus on formatting elements using CSS rules. It's worth noting that for a basic layout involving multiple columns, float has been employed. Flex properties are used in specific instances; however, it's important to mention that their usage is not emphasized in this task.


- **Task 3**: In this task, advanced layout techniques are employed using flex and grid. All pages have the same general layout of three columns. This corresponds to the so-called Holy Grail layout.

- **Task 4**: We emphasize responsiveness by using media queries to manage the layout on mobile devices, tablets and desktops. For the selection of breakpoints, we consulted relevant online sources. As an example, we provide the following <a href="https://www.altamira.ai/blog/common-screen-sizes-for-responsive-web-design">article</a>.


- **Task 5**: In the final task, we complete the website with a sign-up form, the entries of which are validated through appropriate properties of the input element, as well as through JavaScript code. Essentially, with JavaScript code, we validate inputs that cannot be validated through properties of the input element.
