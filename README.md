## Description ðŸ“Œ
Sofari is a website implementing a simplified version of a classified ads search service. The website includes a series of pages (home, advertisements, about us, contact, etc.) with the main functionality being user login, advertisement display, adding ads to favorites, and communication through contact forms. Ads are categorized into categories, which are further divided into subcategories for easier user navigation based on the topic they are searching for. Each ad is accompanied by the price, description, ismage(s) of the product, technical specifications of the product, and other useful information.

## Navigation ðŸ§­
This project consists of two parts:
- In the first part, the website includes only static content which is displayed upon opening each page in the Web Browser, without requiring communication with a Web Server to execute functions or dynamically generate web pages. The implementation is done using HTML5, CSS, and JS, where the latter is only used for complex form validation rules.

- The second part incorporates the content of the first part and further enriches it with dynamic content. The display of categories as well as advertisements within each category is done through dynamic generation of HTML code and its attachment to appropriate points of the web pages. In this part, ads are dynamically loaded from a suitable API that provides access to categories and subcategories of ads as well as ads of selected categories through appropriate requests. Additionally, the use of JS and Web Browser APIs enables user login services and adding ads to favorites.
