* Questions:
    - 2 Fetches that are not concurrent in main.js
    - ls service is POST? Should it respond with a location?
    - afs servise should respond with a location?
    - urls for services (e.g. favourites/add)
    - problem with paths being in the form ./xxxx/xxxx/xxxx
    - localhost/category.html, localhost/subcategory.html what should we serve?
    - image of advertisements (cover or contain?)

* ToDo / Supplementary
    - urls, use 'join' instead of hardcoding
