Questions:
- 2 Fetches that are not concurrent in main.js
- Errors control, status codes control
- LS status code on failure? 401? 

ToDo / Supplementary
- logout
- mongoDB
- random dates
- urls, use 'join' instead of hardcoding
- dataset approach in one of the services (instead of parameter passing)
